/**
 * Fuzz target interface.
 * Fuzz targets have some common parameters passed as macros during compilation.
 * Check the documentation for each individual fuzzer for more parameters.
 *
 * @param STATEFUL_FUZZING:
 *        Define this to reuse state between fuzzer runs. This can be useful to
 *        test code paths which are only executed when contexts are reused.
 *        WARNING: Makes reproducing crashes much harder.
 *        Default: Not defined.
 * @param DEBUGLEVEL:
 *        This is a parameter for the zstd library. Defining `DEBUGLEVEL=1`
 *        enables assert() statements in the zstd library. Higher levels enable
 *        logging, so aren't recommended. Defining `DEBUGLEVEL=1` is
 *        recommended.
 * @param MEM_FORCE_MEMORY_ACCESS:
 *        This flag controls how the zstd library accesses unaligned memory.
 *        It can be undefined, or 0 through 2. If it is undefined, it selects
 *        the method to use based on the compiler.
 * @param FUZZING_BUILD_MODE_UNSAFE_FOR_PRODUCTION
 *        This is the canonical flag to enable deterministic builds for fuzzing.
 *        Changes to zstd for fuzzing are gated behind this define.
 *        It is recommended to define this when building zstd for fuzzing.
